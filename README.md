#Movielens Capstone Project

Movie recommendation systems allow customers to give feedback and rating on movies. Companies collect and analyze data from these systems to recommend similar movies to customers that match their preferences and tastes.
 
Movielens is a publicly available dataset generated by GroupLens Research Lab containing movie ratings from hundreds of thousands of customers reviews. In this project, machine learning models were built on movielens data to predict customer ratings on specific movies.
